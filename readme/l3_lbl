DESCRIPTION                  = "
    This file contains refractivity, bending angle and impact parameter
    profiles derived from Venus Climate Orbiter (VCO, also known as PLANET-C
    and AKATSUKI) radio occultation data. The raw data were processed to
    level 2 and converted to bending angles and impact parameters. These
    results were then inverted to refractive index and refractivity via
    an Abel transform.
  "
NOTE                         = "
    The egress profile might suffer from the effect of a large latitudinal
    movement of the ray path.
