    File naming conventions
    -----------------------

      The file naming conventions for the data files are same over the four
      cameras, UVI, IR1, IR2, and LIR. In addition to the four cameras, the
      data of LAC and RS have very similar file naming conventions. In this
      section, the file naming conventions for the RS data is described.

      The filename has the format

          rs_{YYYY}{MM}{DD}_{hh}{mm}{ss}_{gs}_{level}_[{type}_]v{ver}.{ext}

      where

          {YYYY}:   year in four-digits

          {MM}:     month in two-digits

          {DD}:     day in two-digits

          {hh}:     hour in two-digits

          {mm}:     minute in two-digits

          {ss}:     second in two-digits

            Note that {YYYY}-{MM}-{DD}T{hh}:{mm}:{ss} means the representative
            time of observation in UTC.

          {gs}:     abbreviated name of ground station

          {level}:  abbreviated name of product

            The values of {level} is summarized in the following table. Note
            that the product names, i.e., processing level definition is
            different with other products, such as IR1, IR2, UVI, LIR, and
            LAC.

              {level}  DATA_SET_ID            description
              -------  ---------------------  --------------------------------
              l1       VCO-V-RS-2-OCC-V{VER}  recorded data at the ground
              l2       VCO-V-RS-3-OCC-V{VER}  time series of signal intensity
                                              and dominant frequency
              l3       VCO-V-RS-5-OCC-V{VER}  time series of impact parameter,
                                              refractivity, etc.
              l4       VCO-V-RS-5-OCC-V{VER}  vertical profiles of atmospheric
                                              density, temperature, etc.

            where {VER} is version number of data set, e.g., 1.0.

          {type}:   type of occultation and physical quantity

              {level}  {type}  description
              -------  ------  --------------------------------------------
              l1       --      none, i.e., no ``type'' for this level.

              l2       --      none, i.e., no ``type'' for this level.

              l3       i       data obtained during ingress.
              l3       e       data obtained during egress.

              l4       ai      atmospheric temperature profile obtained during
                               ingress.
              l4       ae      atmospheric temperature profile obtained during
                               egress.

              l4       pi      sulfuric acid vapor mixing ratio profile
                               obtained during ingress.
              l4       pe      sulfuric acid vapor mixing ratio profile
                               obtained during egress.

              l4       ii      electron density profile obtained during
                               ingress.
              l4       ie      electron density profile obtained during
                               egress.

          {ver}:    version string of the product in 2 digits

            The value is larger than or equal to 10. When the version number
            appeared in DATA_SET_ID is multiplied by 10, the result is equal
            to the value of {ver}.

          {ext}:    extension of the file

            The following typical extensions are included in this data set
            The ``data'' directory contains only tab and lbl files.

              {ext}  description
              -----  ---------------------------------
              lbl    PDS3 label file
              tab    table format file with ASCII text
