DESCRIPTION                  = "
    This file contains an atmospheric temperature-pressure profile derived
    from Venus Climate Orbiter (VCO, also known as PLANET-C and AKATSUKI)
    radio occultation data. Atmospheric Doppler frequency time series
    observed at the ground station was converted to bending angle as a
    function of impact parameter. These results were then inverted to
    refractive index as a function of radius via an Abel transform. Number
    density was obtained from refractive index using a conversion formula
    appropriate to the composition of the atmosphere, which is known.
    Pressure and temperature profiles were derived by assuming hydrostatic
    balance and using the ideal gas law.
  "
NOTE                         = "
    The egress profile might suffer from the effect of a large latitudinal
    movement of the ray path.
